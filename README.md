# Stupid Workspace

A workspace for a group of really stupid ideas / projects I plan on dicking around with for the next few days / weeks / hours / whatever. Mostly inspired by this **awesome** [github list](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) of "build-your-own-x" projects. Hopefully if someone has the misfortune of stumbling across my work they at least get to find that project list as a nice reward for suffering through my crap.

Current Project List:
- **stupid-db** Implementation of a simple key-value storage database
- **stupid-db-server** A server which will hold and interact with a `stupid-db`
- **stupid-db-client** A client to test the `stupid-db-server` as well as test usage of `stupid-db`
- **stupid-shell** A simple shell written from scratch

>*Note: All project descriptions above have an implicit "**because I'm an idiot**" at the end.*
