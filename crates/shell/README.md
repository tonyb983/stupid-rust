# Stupid-Shell

A really terrible shell I'm writing from scratch in rust. Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/), I plan on taking the basic skeleton outlined in that article, and fleshing it out as much as I can / want / am actually technically able.

## Various Moving Parts:
- [ ] Basic REPL Loop
- [ ] Write `Command` trait and implement builtins through it's interface
- [ ] Write FD output / redirect parser
- [ ] Add pipe (`|`) support
